# Verify that we get a sensible error message when a script
# fails as part of module mode. Note that what we are also testing
# here is that we don't try to execute the tests against v0.3.0-beta.6
# which is a dummy CUE version (and hence would fail). i.e. the
# run of unity should stop after the failing base version, which
# is PATH

# Initial setup
exec git init
exec git add -A
exec git commit -m 'Initial commit'

# Test
! exec unity test v0.3.0-beta.6
